Stop Writing Clunky UIs. Jetpack Compose Animations Are Easier Than You Think.

This project demonstrates how to build smooth, declarative animations in **Jetpack Compose** with just a few lines of code. No more `AnimatorSet`, no more boilerplate ‚Äî just state-driven UI updates that *feel alive*.

## üöÄ Why Animations Matter

In the old days, even a simple fade-in required `AnimatorSet`, `ViewPropertyAnimator`, or `XML transitions`. It was messy, hard to manage, and often skipped entirely.

But subtle animations are what make an app feel polished and intuitive. With Compose, animations are **part of the declarative UI** ‚Äî no excuses anymore.

## üõ† Core Idea: Animate State Changes

In Compose, the UI is a function of **state**. When state changes, the UI recomposes.  
Animations are simply the *transition* between the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù of that state.

- **`animate*AsState`** ‚Üí smoothly animates simple values like color, size, alpha, padding.
- **`AnimatedVisibility`** ‚Üí handles content appearing/disappearing with enter/exit transitions.

## üì¶ Example: Expandable Card

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ExpandableCard() {
    var expanded by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }

    // Animate background color based on state
    val backgroundColor by animateColorAsState(
        targetValue = if (expanded) MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primaryContainer
                      else MaterialTheme.colorScheme.surfaceVariant,
        label = "backgroundColorAnimation"
    )

    Card(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxWidth()
            .padding(16.dp)
            .clickable { expanded = !expanded },
        colors = CardDefaults.cardColors(containerColor = backgroundColor)
    ) {
        Column(modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)) {
            Text(text = "Tap to Expand", style = MaterialTheme.typography.titleMedium)

            // Animate presence with fade + slide
            AnimatedVisibility(visible = expanded) {
                Text(
                    text = "Here are the extra details! They fade and slide in smoothly, making the UI feel polished.",
                    modifier = Modifier.padding(top = 8.dp)
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
